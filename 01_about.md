I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
[Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) 
at the [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada](https://www.camh.ca). 
My research topics include computer arithmetic, high-performance computing,
reproducibility, and neuroimaging. In addition, my work aims to democratize the use of stability
analysis of scientific computing codes through automatic tools to improve
numerical quality.

I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in [Big Data Infrastructures for Neuroinformatics](https://big-data-lab-team.github.io/index.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca), Montreal, QC, Canada.
I completed my PhD at the [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) ([UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/)), Versailles, France.
I also graduated from UVSQ with a Master's
degree in [High Performance Computing](http://www.chps.uvsq.fr/).
