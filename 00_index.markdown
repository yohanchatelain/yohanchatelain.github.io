I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
[Big Data Infrastructures for Neuroinformatics lab](https://big-data-lab-team.github.io/) 
at [Concordia University, Montreal, Canada](https://www.concordia.ca/). 
My research topics include computer arithmetic, high-performance computing, and
reproducibility. My work aims to democratize the use of stability
analysis of scientific computing codes through automatic tools to improve
numerical quality.
