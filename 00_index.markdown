I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
[Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) 
at the [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada](https://www.camh.ca). 
My research topics include computer arithmetic, high-performance computing,
reproducibility, and neuroimaging. In addition, my work aims to democratize the use of stability
analysis of scientific computing codes through automatic tools to improve
numerical quality.
