I am a postdoctoral researcher in the 
[Big Data Infrastructures for Neuroinformatics lab](https://big-data-lab-team.github.io/) 
at the [University of Concordia, Montreal, Canada](https://www.concordia.ca/). 
My research topics include computer arithmetic, high-performance computing, and
reproducibility. In addition, my work aims at democratizing the use of stability
analysis of scientific computing codes through automatic tools to improve
numerical quality.

I did a PhD at the [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) ([UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/)), Versailles, France.
I also graduated from the UVSQ with a Master
degree in [High Performance Computing](http://www.chps.uvsq.fr/).
