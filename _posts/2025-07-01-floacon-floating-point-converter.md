**Floacon**, a new web-based tool designed to help understand and explore floating-point numbers. This project aims to provide an interactive way to visualize floating-point formats, and to experiment with custom formats.

### About Floacon

Floacon is a web-based floating-point converter and explorer. It allows you to:

*   Define custom floating-point formats (exponent and mantissa bits).
*   Convert decimal values to their binary floating-point representation.
*   Interactively toggle individual bits and observe the resulting decimal value.
*   View various representations (binary, hexadecimal) and format information (bias, epsilon, max/min normal/denormal).

This application is built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages.
