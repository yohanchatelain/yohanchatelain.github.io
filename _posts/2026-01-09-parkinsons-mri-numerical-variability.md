I am thrilled to announce the preprint **"[The practical impact of numerical variability on structural MRI measures of Parkinson's disease](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2026/01/09/2026.01.09.698203.full.pdf)"** is available on bioRxiv.

## Description
This preprint quantifies numerical variability in structural MRI measures of Parkinson's disease by instrumenting FreeSurfer to simulate numerical differences across computational environments. It introduces the Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) to assess how numerical noise can influence reported group differences and clinical associations.
