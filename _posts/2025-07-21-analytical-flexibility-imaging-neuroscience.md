I am thrilled to announce that the paper titled **"[Open-source platforms to investigate analytical flexibility in neuroimaging](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article-pdf/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.79/2534165/imag.a.79.pdf)"** is published in *Imaging Neuroscience*.

## Description
This work presents open-source platforms that enable researchers to explore analytical flexibility in neuroimaging pipelines. By making variability and decision points explicit, these platforms support more transparent, reproducible, and robust analyses.
