I am thrilled to announce the preprint **"[Uncertain but useful: Leveraging cnn variability into data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05238)"** is available on arXiv.

## Description
This work explores how variability in convolutional neural network inference can be turned into a useful signal for data augmentation, with the goal of improving model robustness and generalization.
